[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/codacy/helm-poll/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/codacy/helm-poll/tree/master)

An helm plugin to poll for a release status.

## Project Goals

As per the [Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_status/), a release can have the following final status:

```go
"UNKNOWN", "DEPLOYED", "DELETED", "SUPERSEDED", "FAILED"
```

A final status is a state in which the release does not have any on-going operations, such as an upgrade.

Therefore, to avoid concurrent installation problems, we have created this plugin that polls for the status of a given release until helm returns one of the statuses mentioned above.

This means that once one of these states is met for the release, there is no on-going installation and we are free to proceed.

## Getting Started

The following command will install this plugin with your local copy of helm

Choose the latest version from the releases and install the
appropriate version for your OS:

### Linux

```sh
$ helm plugin install https://github.com/codacy/helm-poll/releases/download/latest/helm-poll-linux.tgz
```

### MacOS

```sh
$ helm plugin install https://github.com/codacy/helm-poll/releases/download/latest/helm-poll-macos.tgz
```

### Windows

```sh
$ helm plugin install https://github.com/codacy/helm-poll/releases/download/latest/helm-poll-windows.tgz
```

### Prerequisites

* [Helm](https://helm.sh/)
* [GoLang](https://golang.org/)

Please note that this plugin will poll in relation to the releases in the cluster that is in your current kubeconfig context.
Make sure you are pointing to the desired cluster before running the plugin.

### Build and run

To build the plugin binary, all you really need to do is:

```bash
go build .
```

You can then run the produced binary with

```bash
./poll

Usage: poll [--help] [-i value] [-r value] [-t value] [parameters ...]
     --help  Help
 -i, --interval=value
             The polling interval in seconds (default: 5)
 -r, --release=value
             Release name to poll for.
 -t, --timeout=value
             The timeout in seconds (default: 300)
```

Upon success, the plugin will return the `json` output corresponding to the release:

```bash
helm poll -r codacy-nightly
```

```json
{
  "Name": "codacy-nightly",
  "Revision": 47,
  "Updated": "Thu Jan 30 13:41:56 2020",
  "Status": "DEPLOYED",
  "Chart": "codacy-0.5.0-NIGHTLY.30-01-2020",
  "AppVersion": "0.5.0-NIGHTLY.30-01-2020",
  "Namespace": "codacy-nightly"
}
```

Because the output is `json`, you can pipe it through `jq` for fancier operations.

Polling for a release that does not exist will return an empty release:

```json
{
  "Name": "",
  "Revision": 0,
  "Updated": "",
  "Status": "",
  "Chart": "",
  "AppVersion": "",
  "Namespace": ""
}
```

## Running the tests

```bash
go test ./... -v
```

## Design

### Defaults

| Parameter     | Description                     | Default  | Required  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| `--release`   | Name of the release to monitor  | `nil`    | True      |
| `--timeout`   | Polling timeout in seconds      | `300`    | False     |
| `--interval`  | Polling interval in seconds     | `5`      | False     |
